# 🚀 LeetcodeConcepts: My Battle Log Against Algorithmic Nightmares  

Welcome, brave soul. If you’ve wandered into this repository, chances are you’re either:  

1. **A fellow warrior** battling the Leetcode beast, seeking guidance on your quest.  
2. **A lost traveler** who clicked one link too many and now wonders why people willingly subject themselves to this torture.  
3. **A recruiter?** (In which case, hi! Look at my code, give me a job.)  

Either way, here lies my **battle log**—a collection of Leetcode problems that pushed me to the brink of sanity. These aren’t just any problems; these are the ones that made me question my life choices, the existence of benevolent deities, and whether arrays should even be a thing.

## 📜 What’s in This Grimoire?  
Inside, you’ll find:  

✅ **Problems that made me cry** (metaphorically… mostly).  
✅ **Solutions that actually work** (after an ungodly number of failed attempts).  
✅ **Comments that may or may not be useful but are definitely entertaining.**  
✅ **A growing collection of problems organized by topic** (because chaos is only fun in moderation).

## 🏆 Categories of Pain  
🔹 **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Where recursion meets existential dread.  
🔹 **Graphs:** Because who doesn’t love a good BFS vs. DFS debate at 3 AM?  
🔹 **Bit Manipulation:** Solving problems by shifting bits and sanity.  
🔹 **Linked Lists:** The data structure equivalent of a bad breakup—always coming back to haunt you.  
🔹 **Trees:** Just a bunch of nested IF statements in disguise.  
🔹 **Greedy Algorithms:** Like that one friend who takes the biggest slice of pizza and still complains.  
🔹 **System Design:** Ah yes, let’s pretend we can scale Twitter in 90 minutes.

## 🔥 Why This Exists  
Because:  
1. **Leetcode is hard.**  
2. **Interviewers are cruel.**  
3. **Memory is fickle.**  
4. **The best way to learn is to suffer through it and document your pain.**  

This repository is my way of making sure I never have to suffer through the same problem twice (hopefully). If it helps you too, congrats—you now owe me coffee.

## ⚡ Contribute (Or Just Commiserate)  
If you find a problem here that also traumatized you, feel free to:  
- **Fork it.** (Like a true coder.)  
- **Star it.** (Validation keeps me alive.)  
- **Open a PR.** (If you think my solution is dumb, which it probably is.)  
- **Drop a comment.** (So we can suffer together.)

## 🤡 Parting Words  
Leetcode is like a bad relationship—you put in all the effort, cry a little, and in the end, you just hope it was worth it.  

Happy coding, and may your recursion always terminate. 😈
